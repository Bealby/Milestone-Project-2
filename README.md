## UX

---

Family and friends will seek to learn more about Jack Fairfield,
through imagery and his footprint around the UK during the
Second World War. 

### STRATEGY

The main focus of this website is to give family and friends
an insight into Jack Fairfield's life. It aims to
bring to life Jack Fairfield's travels with
the use of an interactive map; along with private
photos and brief descrioption of areas he visited
and resided in.

The website needs to be suitable for mobile devices,
suiting users who want to browse the website while on
the move. The desktop and tablet versions however
will provide a more visual and exapansive user experience.

### SCOPE

To meet the gosls of the users the website needs to be
intuitive and easy to use, taking heed of the less
technically savvy audience.

A collection of photos that embrace and capture Jack
Fairfield's life will be essentual to draw
and retain users interest, to achieve the desire to learn more.

The interactive map will highlight key locations in Jack
Fairfield's journey through the Second World War. A brief 
but informative summary for each of these locations will 
be provided along with a photo relevent to the location.

### STRUCTURE

The website's front page will be the window into the website
with a hero-image centered on the page, which when clicked will
take you into the main website.

The naviagtion bar will have a fixed but sticky position with the
links Home, Bio, and Maps.

The Home page will have a large photo that stretches the page,
rotating every 6 seconds with a new photo.

The Bio page will summarise Jack Fairfield's life and history
during the Second World War.

The Map page will show an interactive map that will show locations
using Google Maps API. Each clickable location will bring up a pop
up window with information on the location along with a complementary
photo.
