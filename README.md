The aim of this website is to provide a little history
about my Papa, Jack Fairfield. The website will be mainly
for family friends who have been very keen to learn more
about Jack Fairfield's life during the Second World War.

## UX

---

Family and friends seek to learn more about Jack Fairfield,
through imagery and his footprint around the UK during the
Second World War. 

### STRATEGY

The main focus of this website is to give family and friends
an insight into Jack Fairfields life. To attract users to
learn more about Jack Fairfield's travels with the use of a
interactive map. Along with private photos and a brief
description of the areas he has resided in.

The website needs to come across well on mobile devices,
suiting users who want to browse the website while on
their travels. The desktop and tablet versions however
will provide a more visual and exapansive user experience.

### SCOPE

To meet the gosls of the users the website needs to be
intuitive and easy to use, taking heed of the less
technically savvy audience.

A collection of photos that embrace and capture Jack
Fairfield's life will be essential to draw users interest
and desire to learn more. 

The interactive map will highlight key locations in Jack
Fairfield's journey through the Second World War. A brief 
but informative summary for each of these locations will 
be provided along with a photo relevent to the location.

### STRUCTURE

The website's front page will be the window into the website
with a hero-image centered on the page, which when clicked will
take you into the main website.

The naviagtion bar will have a fixed but sticky position with the
links Home, Bio, and Maps.

The Home page will have a large photo that stretches the page,
rotating every 6 seconds with a new photo.

The Bio page will summarise Jack Fairfield's life and history
during the Second World War.

The Map page will show an interactive map that will show locations
using Google Maps API. Each clickable location will bring up a pop
up window with information on the location along with a complimentary
photo.
