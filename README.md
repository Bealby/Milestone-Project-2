# JACK FAIRFIELD

---

The aim of this website is to provide a little history
about my Papa, Jack Fairfield. The website will be mainly
for family friends who have been very keen to learn more
about Jack Fairfield's life during the Second World War.

## UX

---

Our client desires a website to seek out agents or key contacts, while being
able to use the Website on business cards and on email signatures. Ultimately
these agents or key contacts in the acting world will lead onto bigger and
greater opportunities with producers and directors.

### STRATEGY

The main focus of the website is to allure and attract these agents and key
contacts who can open up new doors in a broad range of roles, including
advertising, theatre and films. With the acting market being heavily
competitive, the website needs to stand out from the crowd; be intuitive
in gaining information; while exuding professionalism.

It needs to come across well on mobile devices while users are on the move,
as well as being highly affective on tablets and desktop to allow for more
comfortable viewing in the office/ home.

Typical comments from key players in the industry include:

- ”Producers and directors work under a lot of pressure. Searching for actors/
   actresses will be a ruthless process”

- “Casting agents mainly seek information on: Naturalness, Personality,
   Professionalism, Well-rounded, Training”

- “It is essential to have an online presence so that casting agents,
    producers an directors who are interested can learn more about you.”

### SCOPE

To meet the client's objectives for the Website an online presence is fundamental
and will be implemented. The client has provided a montage of photos that will
be narrowed down to highlight her different personalities and potentual. A
biography of past and present performances, along with an introduction to
Lisa Fairfield, will be provided by my client. Show reels/ voice reels are
currently in the making and are not ready for the initual launch of the Website.
A blog and further references would also be a good addition to the Website, and
can be addressed at a later date when Lisa Fairfield's career is at the next
level.

The tradeoff in not implementing all desired features mentioned at launch,
will not be detrimental to the website, and the Website can be continually
refreshed and expaned as time passes.

### STRUCTURE

The website needs to be clean and slick without too much clutter and information,
which can cause cognitive overload. It needs to be fresh, stylistic and minimalist
for the artistic audience. At the same time it needs to provide enough content to
promote Lisa Fairfield as an actor. A ‘hero-image’ will be the prominent feature
on the index.html page, alluring potential agents and enticing them to learn more.
The navigation bar and footer will remain fixed through all pages. Alterations will
be made on the navigation bars on mobiles and tablets to maintain the look and feel.

The navigation bar will include tabs for Home, Gallery, Bio, Resume and Contact.
My client’s name will be centered above the navigation bar in clear standout font.
The footer will include a clickable email and telephone number and be viewable in
all pages so that an agent can click intuitively and with ease.

### SURFACE

It is important not to overly glitz-and-glam the website (as the user
may believe), but to keep the website slick and minimal so that is easy for a
potential agent to navigate. I have chosen to use a white color theme with grey
dividers for overall structure. This will allow photos and text to stand out boldly
against the white background.
