# JACK FAIRFIELD

---

The aim of this website is to provide a little history
about my Papa, Jack Fairfield. The website will be mainly
for family friends who have been very keen to learn more
about Jack Fairfield's life during the Second World War.

## UX

---

Family and friends seek to learn more about Jack Fairfield,
through imagery and his footprint around the UK during the
Second World War Two. 

### STRATEGY

The main focus of this website is to give family and friends
an insight into Jack Fairfields life. To attract users to
learn more about Jack Fairfield's travels with the use of a
interactive map. Along with private photos and brief
descriptions of areas he resided in.

It website needs to come across well on mobile devices,
suiting users who want to browse the website while on
their travels. The desktop and tablet versions will provide
a more visual user experience.

### SCOPE

To meet the gosls of the users the website needs to be
intuitiveand easy to use, taking heed of the less
technically savvy audience.

A collection of photos that embrace and capture Jack
Fairfield's life will be essential to draw users interest
and desire to learn more. 

A brief but informative summary of Jack Fairfield, to pave the way for an 
interactive experince using maps. 

Each point on the map will have a photo and comment to bring to life the area 
Jack Fairfield was located.  

A journal has also been written but is currently not complete so can be included at a later date.

### STRUCTURE

The website needs to be clean and slick without too much clutter and information,
which can cause cognitive overload. It needs to be fresh, stylistic and minimalist
for the artistic audience. At the same time it needs to provide enough content to
promote Lisa Fairfield as an actor. A ‘hero-image’ will be the prominent feature
on the index.html page, alluring potential agents and enticing them to learn more.
The navigation bar and footer will remain fixed through all pages. Alterations will
be made on the navigation bars on mobiles and tablets to maintain the look and feel.

The navigation bar will include tabs for Home, Gallery, Bio, Resume and Contact.
My client’s name will be centered above the navigation bar in clear standout font.
The footer will include a clickable email and telephone number and be viewable in
all pages so that an agent can click intuitively and with ease.
